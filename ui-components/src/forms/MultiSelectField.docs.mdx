# Multi-Select Field

The multi-select field component lets you type to autocomplete and select from a list of options which possibly are lazy-loaded from an API. Selected options show as tags below the text input, and those options can also be removed.

## Data Source and Default Values

The multi-select field is based on the [aria-autocomplete](https://github.com/mynamesleon/aria-autocomplete) library. A data source (provided via the `dataSource` prop) supplies either static data for the list of items, or a function which will be called when data is requested (opening the popup or starting to type into the input control) to provide the list of items.

Like other form fields in the Bloom UI component library, [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) is used for field registration, validation, and data sync. You must supply the `register`, `setValue`, and `getValues` methods from the form hook.

Items for a multi-select field should be an array of key-value pairs, where `value` is suitable for data storage/retrieval, and `label` is a human-readable label shown to the user. A dataSource of static data would look something like this:

```js
[
  { label: "Pink Grapefruit", value: "pink-grapefruit" },
  { label: "Red Grapes", value: "red-grapes" }
  ...more
]
```

Whereas a data provider function would look something like this:

```js
const dataProvider = async (
  query: string,
  render: (toRender: any[]) => void, // this second argument can safely be ignored
  isFirstCall: boolean
) => {
  let results

  if (isFirstCall && query !== "undefined") { // true if the field is being initialized with default selections
    // fetch necessary results here looking at `query`. Note that you may want to `.split(",")` the query
  } else {
    // fetch results here based on the `query` from the user's input
  }

  return results.map(item => {
    // customize the mapping of backend data to key-value pairs as necessary:
    return {
      value: item.valueFromResultsItem,
      label: item.labelFromResultsItem
    }
  })
})
```

You can check out the **withPreviousSelections** story for a contrived example of a data provider.

When there's pre-existing selection(s) for a multi-select field, the form's default value should be set to a comma-separated list. Note that these are the "keys" of the data source's key-value pairs as explained above. So if California and Oregon were previously selected, the default value for the form field would be `CA,OR`, and the data source should return a JavaScript array of objects containing:

```js
return [
  { value: "CA", label: "California" },
  { value: "OR", label: "Oregon" },
]
```

## Theming Variables

You can apply CSS variables to the `.multi-select-field` selector to customize the appearance of the component.

| `--list-height`                | Size  | Height of the dropdown options list | `325px`                      |
