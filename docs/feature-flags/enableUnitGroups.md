# Unit Groups - enableUnitGroups

## Name

`enableUnitGroups`

## Description

When true, uses unit groups instead of units.

## Additional Information

Unit groups are completely structurally different than a "unit" meaning everything all the way down to the database model is different. If you have a jurisdiction configured to have unit groups no listing can have "units" so this must be configured and turned on when the jurisdiction is first created. We have additional logic to make sure you can't save a listing with units on.
