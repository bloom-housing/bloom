Note that Google Translate does not preserve markdown well, and you may need to adjust some translations manually to add back in new lines and other missing formatting if there is any markdown.

You can paste these lines directly into each translation file, and then be sure to sort ascending! In VSCode, you can Command + Shift + P --> Sort Ascending.
