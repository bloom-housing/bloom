Other substantially disabling conditions closely related to intellectual disability or which require treatment similar to the treatment required by persons with intellectual disability may be eligible for services. The onset of these conditions had to have been prior to age 18; continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely and constitutes a substantial handicap for the individual.\n\nA Substantial Disability is s a condition which results in major impairment of cognitive and/or social functioning, representing sufficient impairment to require interdisciplinary planning and coordination of special or generic services to assist the individual in achieving maximum potential; and\n\nMust cause significant functional limitations, as determined by the regional center, in three or more of the following areas of major life activity, as appropriate to the person’s age. Since an individual’s cognitive and/or social functioning are many-faceted, the existence of a major impairment shall be determined through assessment(s) in the following areas of daily life activity:\n\n• Receptive and expressive language\n\n• Learning\n\n• Self-care\n\n•Mobility\n\n• Self-direction\n\n• Capacity for independent living\n\n• Economic self-sufficiency\n\nA Developmental Disability shall not include handicapping conditions that are:\n\n• Solely psychiatric disorders where there is impaired intellectual or social functioning which originated as a result of the psychiatric disorder or treatment given for such a disorder. Such psychiatric disorders include psycho-social deprivation and/or psychosis, severe neurosis or personality disorders even where social and intellectual functioning has become seriously impaired as an integral manifestation of the disorder\n\n• Solely learning disabilities. A learning disability is a condition which manifests as a significant discrepancy between estimated cognitive potential and actual level of educational performance, and which is not a result of generalized intellectual disability, educational or psycho-social deprivation, psychiatric disorder, or sensory loss\n\n• Solely physical in nature. These conditions include congenital anomalies or conditions acquired through disease, accident, or faulty development which are not associated with a neurological impairment that results in a need for treatment similar to that required for intellectual disability. Some examples are polio, muscular dystrophy, and arthritis\n\nBy selecting “yes” that you meet the definition for Developmentally Disabled, you give your permission to MidPen Housing to share your information with the Regional Center (or other agency) you have indicated for purposes of confirming your eligibility.",
